# Zinc Finger Proteins Cookbook

This repository contains all the data analysis workflow of Zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) in my published and to-be-published work, including CTCF, ZIM3, ZFP3, ZNF343, ZNF140, ZNF675, etc. The analysis protocols are organized into subdirectories by the name of corresponding ZFP. Some work has been published in varous journals, i.e,

[Zheng Zuo and others, On the dependent recognition of some long zinc finger proteins, Nucleic Acids Research, 2023;gkad207](https://academic.oup.com/nar/advance-article/doi/10.1093/nar/gkad207/7084599?searchresult=1)

[Zuo, Z. THE1B may have no role in human pregnancy due to ZNF430-mediated silencing. Mobile DNA 14, 6 (2023)](https://mobilednajournal.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13100-023-00294-6)

Please contact me if you have any question.

For most studied ZFPs, [TFCookbook](https://github.com/zeropin/TFCookbook) package is used for specificity modelling and can be installed via:

```r
remotes::install_github("zeropin/TFCookbook")
```
