This repository contains all the data analysis workflow of Zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) in my published and to-be-published work, including CTCF, ZIM3, ZFP3, ZNF343, ZNF140, ZNF675, etc. The analysis protocols are organized into subdirectories by the name of corresponding ZFP. Some work has been published in varous journals, i.e,
