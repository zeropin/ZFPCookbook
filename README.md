# Zinc Finger Proteins Cookbook

This repository contains all the data analysis workflow of Zinc finger proteins (ZFPs) in my published and to-be-published work, including CTCF, ZIM3, ZFP3, ZNF343, ZNF140, ZNF675, etc. The analysis protocol is organized into subdirectory by the name of corresponding ZFP. Please contact me if you have any question.

For most studied ZFPs, TFCookbook package is used for specificity modelling and can be installed via:

```r
remotes::install_github("zeropin/TFCookbook")
```
