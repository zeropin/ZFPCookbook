ZFP3 is a 13-finger long C2H2-type zinc finger protein in human genome. According to my recent work about its in vitro and in vivo recognition property, it is predicted to be a positive regulator of microtubule organization and ciliogenesis process, which coincides with the fact that it is specifically upregulated in multiple ciliated cells.

This repository contains all the data analysis workflow for my upcoming ZFP3 paper. If you have any question or issue, please do not hesitate to contact me (zeropin@live.cn).
