ZNF10 is a KRAB-containing zinc finger gene in human genome, and Spec-seq data analysis indicats it preferentially recognizes some site within LINE1 ORF2 region. This directory contains analysis workflow for its Spec-seq derived motif and LINE-1 assocations during evolutionary history.

The raw sequencing data can be accsessed via NCBI GEO database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE189817)
