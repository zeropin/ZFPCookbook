ZNF140 is a human zinc finger protein containing 10 fingers. In our to-be-published work, we found it recognizes two distinct motifs using first four fingers, i.e., Compressed and Extended motifs respectively.
We hypothesized that this "One TF, two motifs" phenomenon is not unique and might be relevant for its biological function of Transposon silencing. I performed Spec-seq to quantitatively characterize its specificity and confirmed this dual motifs structure.
