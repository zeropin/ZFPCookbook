This sub-repository contains the data analysis workflow of ZNF430 and its paralog ZNF100, which target THE1B and THE1A retroviruses in human genome respectively.

[TECookbook package](https://github.com/zeropin/TECookbook) is used in extracting putative binding sites within THE1B elements. Alternatively, the binding sites data can be directly loaded from [precompiled data](data/ZNF430.full.sites.RData).

Some datasets from [ENCODE database](https://www.encodeproject.org/) and [NCBI GEO database](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE200760) are analyzed in the Aggregate signals workflow.

Please contact me if you have any question.
